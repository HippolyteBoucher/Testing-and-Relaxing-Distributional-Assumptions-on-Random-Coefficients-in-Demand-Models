	abstract = {Competing standards often proliferate in the early years of product markets, potentially leading to socially ineﬃcient investment. This paper studies the effect of compatibility in the U.S. electric vehicle market, which has grown ten-fold in its ﬁrst ﬁve years but has three incompatible standards for charging stations. I develop and estimate a structural model of consumer vehicle choice and car manufacturer investment that demonstrates the ambiguous impact of mandating compatibility standards on market outcomes and welfare. Compatibility may beneﬁt consumers by providing access to all existing charging stations. However, ﬁrms may cut back on their investments because the beneﬁts from one ﬁrm’s investments spill over to rivals. Firm response in investment may erode consumer gains from compatibility. I estimate my model using U.S. data from 2011 to 2015 on vehicle registrations and charging station investment and identify demand elasticities with variation in federal and state subsidy policies. Counterfactual simulations show that mandating compatibility in charging standards would decrease duplicative investment in charging stations by car manufacturers and increase the size of the electric vehicle market.},

The paper introduces several procedures for consistently selecting the correct moment conditions. The procedures also can consistently determine whether there is a sufficient number of correct moment conditions to identify the unknown parameters of interest. The paper specifies moment selection criteria that are GMM analogues of the widely used BIC and AIC model selection criteria. (The latter is not consistent.) The paper also considers downward and upward testing procedures. All of the moment selection procedures discussed in this paper are based on the minimized values of the GMM criterion function for different vectors of moment conditions. The procedures are applicable in time-series and cross-sectional contexts. Application of the results of the paper to instrumental variables estimation problems yields consistent procedures for selecting instrumental variables.},

In this paper, we analyze detailed information of 70,000 fourth-graders attending about 1,200 publicly subsidized schools in the context of the Chilean voucher system. We model the school choice of a household as a discrete choice of a single school, based on the random utility model developed by McFadden (1974) and the speciﬁcation of Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995), which includes choicespeciﬁc unobservable characteristics and deals with potential endogeneity. Our results imply that households value some attributes of schools, with the two most important dimensions being test scores and distance to school. Interestingly, at the same time, our results suggest there is a lot of heterogeneity in preferences because the valuation of most school attributes depend on household characteristics. In particular, we ﬁnd that while proximity to school is an inferior attribute, test scores is a normal attribute. We present evidence that our results are mainly driven by self-selection and not by school-side selection. As a ﬁnal check, we compute the average enrollment elasticity with respect to all school attributes and ﬁnd that higher elasticities are correlated with higher supply of the attribute, especially in the case of test scores-enrollment elasticities for private schools.},

In this paper, we explore the possibility of imposing shape restrictions to improve the performance of the NPIV estimators. We assume that the function to be estimated is monotone and consider a sieve estimator that enforces this monotonicity constraint. We deﬁne a constrained measure of ill-posedness that is relevant for the constrained estimator and show that, under a monotone IV assumption and certain other mild regularity conditions, this measure is bounded uniformly over the dimension of the sieve space. This ﬁnding is in stark contrast to the well-known result that the unconstrained sieve measure of illposedness that is relevant for the unconstrained estimator grows to inﬁnity with the dimension of the sieve space. Based on this result, we derive a novel non-asymptotic error bound for the constrained estimator. The bound gives a set of data-generating processes for which the monotonicity constraint has a particularly strong regularization effect and considerably improves the performance of the estimator. The form of the bound implies that the regularization effect can be strong even in large samples and even if the function to be estimated is steep, particularly so if the NPIV model is severely ill-posed. Our simulation study conﬁrms these ﬁndings and reveals the potential for large performance gains from imposing the monotonicity constraint.},

Both commands are able to impose monotonicity of the estimated function. The use of such a shape restriction may signiﬁcantly improve the performance of the NPIV estimator (Chetverikov and Wilhelm 2017). This is because the ill-posedness of the NPIV estimation problem leads to unconstrained estimators that suﬀer from particularly poor statistical properties such as very high variance. The constrained estimator that imposes the monotonicity, on the other hand, signiﬁcantly reduces variance by removing oscillations of the estimator that is nonmonotone.

We prove that the distribution of random coefficients in the multinomial logit model is nonparametrically identified. Our approach requires variation in product characteristics only locally and does not rely on the special regressors with large supports used in related papers. One of our two identification arguments is constructive. Both approaches may be applied to other choice models with random coefficients.}

Taking account of revenue recycling, the impact of a 25-cent gasoline tax increase on the average household is about \$30 per year (2001 dollars). Distributional impacts depend importantly on how additional revenues from the tax increase are recycled. (JEL D12, H22, H25, L62, L71)},

Despite a modest undervaluation of fuel costs, fuel taxes are more effective in reducing fuel usage than product taxes. They also perform better in terms of welfare, even when usage demand is held fixed. The reason is that fuel taxes better target high mileage consumers to purchase fuel efficient cars.

	abstract = {There have been dramatic swings in retail gasoline prices over the past decade, along with reports in the media of consumers changing their driving habits {\textemdash} providing a unique opportunity to examine how consumers respond to changes in gasoline prices. This paper exploits a unique and extremely rich vehicle-level dataset of all new vehicles registered in California in 2001{\textendash}2003 and then subsequently given a smog check in 2005{\textendash}2009, a period of steady economic growth but rapidly increasing gasoline prices after 2005. The primary empirical result is a medium-run estimate of the elasticity of vehicle-miles-traveled with respect to gasoline price for new vehicles of -0.22. There is evidence of considerable heterogeneity in this elasticity across buyer types, demographics, and geography. Surprisingly, the vehicle-level responsiveness is increasing with income, perhaps due to within-household switching of vehicles. The estimated elasticity has important implications for the effectiveness of price policies, such as increased gasoline taxes or a carbon policy, in reducing greenhouse gases. The heterogeneity in the elasticity underscores differing distributional and local air pollution benefits of policies that increase the price of gasoline.},

We provide the first evidence on consumer valuation of fuel economy from a natural experiment. We examine the short-run equilibrium effects of an exogenous restatement of fuel-economy ratings that affected 1.6 million vehicles. Using the implied changes in willingness-to-pay, we find that consumers act myopically: consumers are indifferent between \$1 in discounted fuel costs and 15-38 cents in the vehicle purchase price when discounting at 4\%. This myopia persists under a wide range of assumptions.},

The test combines the methodology of the conditional moment test and nonparametric estimation techniques. Using degenerate and nondegenerate U-statistic theories, the test statistic is shown to be asymptotically distributed standard normal under the null hypothesis that the parametric model is correct, while diverging to infinity at a rate arbitrarily close to n, the sample size, if the parametric model is misspecified. Therefore, the test is consistent against all deviations from the parametric model. The test is robust to heteroskedasticity. A version of the test can be constructed which will have asymptotic power equal to 1 against any local alternatives approaching the null at rates slower than the parametric rate 1/,/{\textasciitilde}. A simulation study reveals that the test has good finite-sample properties.},

We describe examples, theoretical calculations and simulations to elucidate situations in which the speciﬁcation is and is not important. A key conclusion is the large degree of robustness of maximum likelihood for a wide variety of commonly encountered situations.

 abstract = {Instrumental variable (IV) methods are widely used to identify causal effects in models with endogenous explanatory variables. Often the instrument exclusion restriction that underlies the validity of the usual IV inference is suspect; that is, instruments are only plausibly exogenous. We present practical methods for performing inference while relaxing the exclusion restriction. We illustrate the approaches with empirical examples that examine the effect of 401(k) participation on asset accumulation, price elasticity of demand for margarine, and returns to schooling. We find that inference is informative even with a substantial relaxation of the exclusion restriction in two of the three cases.},

 abstract = {Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) have become a frequently used tool for the analysis of non-Gaussian longitudinal data. Estimation is based on maximum likelihood theory, which assumes that the underlying probability model is correctly specified. Recent research is showing that the results obtained from these models are not always robust against departures from the assumptions on which these models are based. In the present work we have used simulations with a logistic random-intercept model to study the impact of misspecifying the random-effects distribution on the type I and II errors of the tests for the mean structure in GLMMs. We found that the misspecification can either increase or decrease the power of the tests, depending on the shape of the underlying random-effects distribution, and it can considerably inflate the type I error rate. Additionally, we have found a theoretical result which states that whenever a subset of fixed-effects parameters, not included in the random-effects structure equals zero, the corresponding maximum likelihood estimator will consistently estimate zero. This implies that under certain conditions a significant effect could be considered as a reliable result, even if the random-effects distribution is misspecified. /// Les modèles linéaires mixtes généralisés (GLMM) sont devenus un outil fréquemment utilisé pour l'analyse de données longitudinales non gaussiennes. L'estimation est basée sur la théorie du maximum de vraisemblance qui suppose que le modèle de probabilité sous-jacent est correctement spécifié. Des travaux récents ont montré que les résultats obtenus à partir de ces modèles ne sont pas toujours robustes vis-à-vis d'écarts aux suppositions sur lesquelles ces modèles sont basés. Dans le présent travail nous avons utilisé des simulations avec un model logistique à valeurs à l'origine aléatoires pour étudier l'impact d'une mauvaise spécification de la distribution des effets aléatoires sur les erreurs de type I et II des tests de la structure moyenne des GLMM. Nous avons constaté que la mauvaise spécification peut soit accroître ou décroître la puissance des tests suivant la forme de la distribution des effets aléatoires sous-jacents, et cela peut augmenter considérablement le taux d'erreur de type I. Nous avons de plus trouvé un résultat théorique qui affirme que chaque fois qu'un sous-ensemble de paramètres à effets fixes, non inclus dans la structure des effets aléatoires, est égal à zéro, l'estimateur du maximum de vraisemblance correspondant estime logiquement zéro. Ce résultat implique que sous certaines conditions un effet significatif peut être considéré comme un résultat fiable même si la distribution des effets aléatoires est mal spécifiée.},

Specifically, we evaluate the asymptotic relative bias that results from incorrect assumptions regarding the random effects. We compare the impact of model violation for two parameterisations of the regression model. Substantial bias in the conditionally specified regression point estimators can result from using a simple random intercepts model when either the random effects distribution depends on measured covariates or there are autoregressive random effects. A marginally specified regression structure that is estimated using maximum likelihood is much less susceptible to bias resulting from random effects model misspecification.},

    abstract = {We revisit the classic semi‐parametric problem of inference on a low‐dimensional parameter θ0 in the presence of high‐dimensional nuisance parameters η0. We depart from the classical setting by allowing for η0 to be so high‐dimensional that the traditional assumptions (e.g. Donsker properties) that limit complexity of the parameter space for this object break down. To estimate η0, we consider the use of statistical or machine learning (ML) methods, which are particularly well suited to estimation in modern, very high‐dimensional cases. ML methods perform well by employing regularization to reduce variance and trading off regularization bias with overfitting in practice. However, both regularization bias and overfitting in estimating η0 cause a heavy bias in estimators of θ0 that are obtained by naively plugging ML estimators of η0 into estimating equations for θ0. This bias results in the naive estimator failing to be N−1/2 consistent, where N is the sample size. We show that the impact of regularization bias and overfitting on estimation of the parameter of interest θ0 can be removed by using two simple, yet critical, ingredients: (1) using Neyman‐orthogonal moments/scores that have reduced sensitivity with respect to nuisance parameters to estimate θ0; (2) making use of cross‐fitting, which provides an efficient form of data‐splitting. We call the resulting set of methods double or debiased ML (DML). We verify that DML delivers point estimators that concentrate in an N−1/2‐neighbourhood of the true parameter values and are approximately unbiased and normally distributed, which allows construction of valid confidence statements. The generic statistical theory of DML is elementary and simultaneously relies on only weak theoretical requirements, which will admit the use of a broad array of modern ML methods for estimating the nuisance parameters, such as random forests, lasso, ridge, deep neural nets, boosted trees, and various hybrids and ensembles of these methods. We illustrate the general theory by applying it to provide theoretical properties of the following: DML applied to learn the main regression parameter in a partially linear regression model; DML applied to learn the coefficient on an endogenous variable in a partially linear instrumental variables model; DML applied to learn the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect on the treated under unconfoundedness; DML applied to learn the local average treatment effect in an instrumental variables setting. In addition to these theoretical applications, we also illustrate the use of DML in three empirical examples.},

Taking account of revenue recycling, the impact of a 25-cent gasoline tax increase on the average household is about \$30 per year (2001 dollars). Distributional impacts depend importantly on how additional revenues from the tax increase are recycled. (JEL D12, H22, H25, L62, L71)},

I develop a model of vehicle choice and utilization to explore the importance of selection based on anticipated driving for estimating the driving responsiveness to changing gasoline prices. Using a unique dataset of new personal vehicle registrations and odometer readings, I find a medium-run gasoline price elasticity of driving of -0.15 and of fuel economy of 0.09. Abstracting from selection leads to an over-estimate of the gasoline price responsiveness. A counterfactual policy simulation of a feebate suggests a relatively small short-run rebound effect of increased driving.},

	abstract = {There have been dramatic swings in retail gasoline prices over the past decade, along with reports in the media of consumers changing their driving habits {\textemdash} providing a unique opportunity to examine how consumers respond to changes in gasoline prices. This paper exploits a unique and extremely rich vehicle-level dataset of all new vehicles registered in California in 2001{\textendash}2003 and then subsequently given a smog check in 2005{\textendash}2009, a period of steady economic growth but rapidly increasing gasoline prices after 2005. The primary empirical result is a medium-run estimate of the elasticity of vehicle-miles-traveled with respect to gasoline price for new vehicles of -0.22. There is evidence of considerable heterogeneity in this elasticity across buyer types, demographics, and geography. Surprisingly, the vehicle-level responsiveness is increasing with income, perhaps due to within-household switching of vehicles. The estimated elasticity has important implications for the effectiveness of price policies, such as increased gasoline taxes or a carbon policy, in reducing greenhouse gases. The heterogeneity in the elasticity underscores differing distributional and local air pollution benefits of policies that increase the price of gasoline.},
